The layer was derived from a variety of source maps including PLSS corner tie sheets, section summaries and other survey maps filed in the County Surveyor's office.  Quarter and Quarter-Quarter divisions were established by existing survey when applicable.  In the absence of survey data straight line intersects between quarter corners was used to establish quarter and quarter-quarter lines.  The index layer is available in a county-wide or individual layer for each township, city, or village.",

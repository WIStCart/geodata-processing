 "dc_description_s": "Point representation of closed environmental remediation sites. Includes Environmental Repair Program (ERP) and Leaking Underground Storage Tank (LUST) sites where contamination affected soil, groundwater or other media, but the department has determined, based on information available at the time, that no further remedial action is required. A \"site\" is a contamination incident, not a property. A site may be smaller than a property or may include more than one property.\u00a0Does not include:spills (immediate cleanup); sites where DNR required no action; sites not yet mapped; and sites never reported to DNR.To view\u00a0more contamination data layers see the RR Sites Map at\u00a0\u00a0https://dnr.wi.gov/topic/Brownfields/rrsm.html",

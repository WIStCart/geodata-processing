The primary source of the linework in this Index is a WI County Boundaries data layer derived from 1:24,000-scale sources. The delineations of DEM/Hillshade extent provided through this Index are approximate and may not reflect the precise extent of the source LiDAR data from which the DEMs and Hillshades are derived.

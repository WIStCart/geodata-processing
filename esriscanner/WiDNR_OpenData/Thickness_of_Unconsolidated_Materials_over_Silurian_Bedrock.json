 "dc_title_s": "Thickness of Unconsolidated Materials over Silurian Bedrock",
 "dc_description_s": "This dataset represents the approximate thickness of unconsolidated materials (over Silurian bedrock) as well as the approximate distribution of the Silurian bedrock in eastern Wisconsin. Developed in 2017, It is a composite of six Wisconsin Geological and Natural History Survey (WGNHS) published maps which range in scale from 1:100,000 to 1:1,000,000, published in 1978, 1979, 1982, 2004, 2011, and 2013. This dataset is part of the 2016-2018\u00a0NR 151 target performance standard rule revision. Its intent is to be a tool for affected entities in the Wisconsin agricultural community to use in order to maintain compliance with the NR 151 target performance standard. It is not recommended to be used for well installation, placement of utility lines, or any other construction or siting practice.",

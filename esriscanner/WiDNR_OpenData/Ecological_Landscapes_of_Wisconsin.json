The Ecological Landscapes of Wisconsin are represented on a May, 1999 map prepared under the direction of the DNR Division of Land Ecosystem Management Planning Team.The NHFEU concept, developed by the USFS, is considered one of the oldest and best-documented ecosystem classification schemes at the federal level. The NHFEU has been refined over the years as new information becomes available to identify lower levels of the hierarchy.",

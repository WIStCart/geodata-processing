 "dc_description_s": "This is a polygon layer derived from a 1:500,000-scale map showing the original, pre-settlement vegetation cover in Wisconsin. The original vegetation cover data was digitized in 1990 from a 1976 map created from land survey notes written in the mid-1800s when Wisconsin was first surveyed. Linework representing lakes and other hydrographic areas in other data sets were subsequently merged with the original vegetation cover data set to more closely match the source map.This digital version of the original vegetation cover map can be used to identify regional changes in land cover since the time when the state was first surveyed.\u00a0 The data is not intended for landscape-scale analysis.All 72 counties of Wisconsin are represented.\u00a0 Islands in Lake Michigan and Lake Superior belonging to Wisconsin counties are also represented.See associated join tables:\u00a0 LUC_Level_Codes\u00a0and Veg_Type_Codes",

It evaluates locations of relative vulnerability to sheet, rill, and gully erosion using information about topography, soils, rainfall, and land cover. This tool enables watershed managers to prioritize and focus field-scale data collection efforts, thus saving time and money while increasing the probability of locating fields with high sediment and nutrient export for implementation of best management practices (BMPs).*to\u00a0open this\u00a0web page\u00a0from\u00a0the DNR Open Data Portal, click the Open button on the right side of the\u00a0EVAAL V1.0\u00a0item page.",

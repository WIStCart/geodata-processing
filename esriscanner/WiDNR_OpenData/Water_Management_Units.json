Basins and watersheds are\n     interconnected areas of land draining from surrounding ridge tops to a\n     common point such as a lake or confluence with a neighboring land area.\n\n\n\u00a0\nThese basins, delineated\nby DNR, generally indicate areas that drain into a common river system or lake,\nbut may also be based on DNR basin management criteria.\n\n",

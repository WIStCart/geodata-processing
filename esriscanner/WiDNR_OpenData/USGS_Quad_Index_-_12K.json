 "dc_description_s": "This polygon layer provides an index grid based intervals of 3.75 degrees minutes latitude by 3.75 minutes longitude. The units delineated by this index grid correspond to quarters of the US Geological Survey's 7.5-minute (1:24,000-scale) topographic map quadrangles. For that reason the 3.75-by-3.75 degree grid is often referred to as a quarter-quad grid, or 1:12,000-scale grid. A 3.75-by-3.75-degree tiling scheme is used by the USGS for standard Digital Orthophoto Quads (DOQs).",

 "dc_description_s": "Abstract:\u00a0Land Type Associations (LTAs) of Wisconsin represent a further definition of the National Hierarchical Framework of Ecological Units (NHFEU). The NHFEU is an ecological classification system that divides landscapes into ecologically significant regions at multiple scales. Ecological types are classified and units are mapped based on the associations of biotic and environmental factors which include climate, physiography, water, soils, air, hydrology, and potential natural communities.\u00a0This dataset can be joined to Land Type Associations_Geology and Land Type Associations_Soil using the LTA_CODE field.Purpose: In Wisconsin, Land Type Associations and other levels of the NHFEU have been delineated and are being used as large-scale ecological units for resource assessment and planning projects. Wisconsin delineated the finer \"landscape\" scale LTA layer of the NHFEU. The development of this layer of information supplies a spatially oriented, ecological classification tool that is available to a variety of landowners, land managers, and resource interest groups in Wisconsin and the Great Lake States.\u00a0Supplemental Information: Land Type Association (LTA) information depicts subregional and landscape ecological units developed according to the classification scheme of the NHFEU (Avers et al., 1994) at 1:250,000 scale. The LTAs were developed, mapped and described in participation with a variety of agencies, organizations, and individuals. Development of ecological units is an iterative process which will progress as additional information becomes available, and from peer review and comments by users of this information. This data is reviewed annually. Agencies that participated on the Wisconsin LTA Project Team include the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, the Natural Resources Conservation Service, the USDA Forest Service (State and Private Forestry and National Forests), the Wisconsin County Forest Association, the University of Wisconsin (at Madison and Stevens Point), Menominee Tribal Enterprise, and the Wisconsin Geological and Natural History Survey. For a detailed explanation of the contents of the LTA dataset, processing steps used in its development, and guidelines for use of the LTA dataset information, refer to the following documentation, available upon request from the\u00a0Wisconsin DNR: \"LTA Data Dictionary\"; \"LTA Processing Procedure\"; \"LTA User's Guide\".",

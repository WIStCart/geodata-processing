 "dc_description_s": "This service provides an Index to help determine the year of air photo acquisition, pixel resolution, and source format of aerial photography that displays in the\u00a0Wisconsin Leaf-Off Digital Orthophotography image service. The delineations of air photo coverage provided through this Index are approximate, and may not reflect the precise extent of corresponding aerial photography in the historical aerial photography service. The primary source of the linework in this Index is a WI County Boundaries data layer derived from 1:24,000- scale sources.  NOTE: Aerial photography often overlaps from one county to one or more adjacent counties. In most cases, seam lines or discontinuities in the air photos along county boundaries can help can users determine the actual extent of a given county's aerial photography as represented in this index.For more information, contact\u00a0https://dnr.wi.gov/feedback\u00a0and select the Subject Geographic Information System\u00a0Data.",

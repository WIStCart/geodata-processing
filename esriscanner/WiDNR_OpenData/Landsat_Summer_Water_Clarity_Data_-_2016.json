 "dc_title_s": "Landsat Summer Water Clarity Data - 2016",
 "dc_description_s": "Satellite derived Secchi depth values (Landsat_SecchiDepth_2016.tif) and image acquisition dates (Landsat_PathInfo_2016.shp)\u00a0 for four 2016 dates\u00a0with satellite derived water clarity measurements.This raster dataset represents satellite-derived water clarity measurements for thousands of lakes across Wisconsin. These measurements are derived from remote sensing data from the NASA/USGS Landsat Program with the support of Citizen Lake Monitoring Network (CLMN) volunteers for the collection of on-the-ground data. CLMN volunteers collect Secchi depth data when the satellites are overhead to calibrate a model for the retrieval of water clarity data from satellite images. The calibrated model is used to produce summer water clarity maps and average summer water clarity values for lakes across Wisconsin. The maps provide information to compare the variability in water clarity at the lake and regional level. The water clarity dataset is scaled from < 1 to > 16 ft to emphasize the variability in water clarity.The State of Wisconsin is represented by four different paths of the Landsat reference system and the images for these paths are acquired 2, 7, and 9 days apart. This means the combined summer water clarity maps take four different dates to produce an annual summer water clarity composite for Wisconsin. Therefore, the water clarity dataset represents the combined water clarity maps for four different dates mosaicked from Lake Michigan in the eastern part of the state to the Mississippi River in the western part of the state. There are some areas where two paths overlap and a single lake might include data from two different dates.\u00a0\u00a0The\u00a0Summer Water Clarity Path Date Index shapefile\u00a0represents a list of these dates.For more information, please visit the Wisconsin DNR's\u00a0Remote sensing of water quality\u00a0web\u00a0page.\u00a0 \u00a0The water clarity dataset represents the data for the latest year with satellite derived water clarity measurements.\u00a0\u00a0Please contact Daniela Gurlin\u00a0(daniela.gurlin@wisconsin.gov) to request additional datasets.\n\n",

 "dc_description_s": "1:250,000 scale shapefile used in preparing the GCSM, and containing information on Wisconsin soil associations. By definition, a soil association is a landscape that has a distinctive proportional pattern of soils; it normally consists of one or more major soils and at least one minor soil, and is named for the major soil. The soil associations layer was digitized from the1:250,000-scale compilation sheets of a 1968 soils map of Wisconsin (Hole et. al). The soil associations in this layer were subsequently grouped into 4 \"soil characteristics\" categories for use in the GCSM. For the purposes of the GCSM, soil depth was considered to extend from the land surface to 5 feet below the land surface.See the usage documentation (https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=e1e89ae505594459a46407f1daf4ad5d) and the Full report (https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=fd4d0c43abc04b4ab915586d9a0e89dd) for more information.",

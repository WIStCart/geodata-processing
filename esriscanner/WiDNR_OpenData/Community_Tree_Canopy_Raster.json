 "dc_description_s": "This land classification\u00a0raster was derived from 2013 National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP) images. \u00a0It classifies land within all municipal boundaries and Census-defined urban areas into one of five categories: tree/shrub, grass/herbaceous, impervious surface, water or wetland.\u00a0 The original process classified land into three types, but then water and wetland areas were masked out using polygons provided by the DNR. Pixel size is 1 meter.\u00a0 \n\n*to download\u00a0this\nitem\u00a0from\u00a0the DNR Open Data Portal,\u00a0simply\u00a0visit\nthe\u00a0item and your browser will automatically prompt you to download it.\n\n",

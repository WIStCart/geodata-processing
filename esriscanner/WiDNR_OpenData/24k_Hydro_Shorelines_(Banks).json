 "dc_description_s": "Hydro Bank represents all the bank lines including complete Great Lake shorelines. Features were collected from water areas represented on the US Geological Survey's 1:24,000-scale topographic map series such as perennial and intermittent streams, lakes, reservoirs etc. A large portion of the DNR's unique IDs for waterbodies (Waterbody Identification Codes - WBICs) have been incorporated into the 24K Hydro layer, along with surface water names from the USGS Geographic Names Information System (GNIS). WaterBody WBIC will be related to its corresponding banks by attribute Waterbody_HydroID.Visit\u00a0https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=cb1c7f75d14f42ee819a46894fd2e771\u00a0to download the entire 24k Hydro file geodatabase.",

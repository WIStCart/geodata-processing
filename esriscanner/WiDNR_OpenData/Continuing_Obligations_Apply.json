 "dc_description_s": "Point representation of Environmental Repair Program (ERP), Leaking Underground Storage Tank (LUST) and Facility-wide sites with continuing obligations which are certain actions for which property owners are legally responsible. They still apply after a property is sold - each new owner becomes responsible for them.\u00a0 The state provides notice to the public by adding the property and related continuing obligation information to the DNR's Wisconsin Remediation and Redevelopment Database (WRRD) established in accordance with s. 292.12(3), Wis. Stats [PDF exit DNR].The two most common continuing obligations are: 1. proper management of contaminated soil if it is excavated; and 2. obtaining approval for construction of water supply wells. Other property-specific obligations may apply. Source: Wisconsin DNR, Remediation & Redevelopment Program; Date: Continuously Updated. For more information see: https://dnr.wi.gov/topic/brownfields/residual.html. Data does not include:Hazardous substance \"spills\" (i.e., locations where a cleanup confirmed by laboratory analysis is generally completed within 60 to 90 days) Some recent sites that are not yet mappedSome sites with soil contamination above chapter NR 720 residual contaminant levels for cleanups approved prior to August 1, 2002Locations where a discharge or potential discharge was reported to the DNR and the DNR determined that no investigation is requiredSites never reported to the DNR.To view\u00a0more contamination data layers see the RR Sites Map at\u00a0\u00a0https://dnr.wi.gov/topic/Brownfields/rrsm.html,\u00a0or for specific site information search BRRTS on the Web at https://dnr.wi.gov/botw/SetUpBasicSearchForm.do.",

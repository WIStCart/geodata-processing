 "dc_description_s": "The WDNR major basin boundaries were derived from the Subbasin (8-digit) 4th level hydrologic units from the digital Watershed Boundary Dataset for the State of Wisconsin. HUCs were clipped to the state boundary, then dissolved on the major basin code (which was added manually after the clip process).\u00a0 Area and perimeter were then recalculated.\u00a0 This data set consists of georeferenced digital data and associated attributes created in accordance with the \"FGDC Proposal, Version 1.0 - Federal Standards For Delineation of Hydrologic Unit Boundaries 3/01/02\".\u00a0 These polygons are attributed with hydrologic unit codes and names for 4th level sub-basins.\u00a0 The dataset extent is the state of Wisconsin, plus the extent of 8-digit HUCs that extend across the state line into northern Illinois and western upper Michigan.",

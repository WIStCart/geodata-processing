 "dc_description_s": "Path date index shapefile for the Landsat Summer Water Clarity Data - 2016 raster dataset.\u00a0\u00a0 The State of Wisconsin is represented by four different paths of the Landsat reference system and the images for these paths are acquired 2, 7, and 9 days apart. This means the combined summer water clarity maps take four different dates to produce an annual summer water clarity composite for Wisconsin. Therefore, the water clarity dataset represents the combined water clarity maps for four different dates mosaicked from Lake Michigan in the eastern part of the state to the Mississippi River in the western part of the state. There are some areas where two paths overlap and a single lake might include data from two different dates. The Summer Water Clarity Path Date Index shapefile represents a list of these dates.For more information, please visit the Wisconsin DNR's\u00a0Remote sensing of water quality\u00a0web page.\u00a0\u00a0 Please contact Daniela Gurlin (daniela.gurlin@wisconsin.gov) to request additional datasets.\n\n",

Generally, Facility-wide sites\u00a0are large sites with continuing operations that have one or more smaller sites with\u00a0soil and/or groundwater contamination. There may also be some activities at the same location that should not be part of the Facility-wide activity type because they are not covered by the negotiated agreement.For more information\u00a0visit the Remediation and Redevelopment program\u00a0website.",

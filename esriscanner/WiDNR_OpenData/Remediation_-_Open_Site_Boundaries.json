A site may be smaller than a property or may include more than one property.Does not include:spills (immediate cleanup); sites where DNR required no action; sites not yet mapped; and sites never reported to DNR.To view\u00a0more contamination data layers see the RR Sites Map at\u00a0\u00a0https://dnr.wi.gov/topic/Brownfields/rrsm.html,\u00a0or for specific site information search BRRTS on the Web at https://dnr.wi.gov/botw/SetUpBasicSearchForm.do.",

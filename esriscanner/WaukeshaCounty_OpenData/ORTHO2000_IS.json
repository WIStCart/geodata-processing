 "dc_description_s": "This data set consists of digital orthophoto images obtained from 1:20,000 scale black-and-white aerial photography aquired in the spring of 2000.  The orthophoto files are prepared at two different scales: 1\"\"=400' and 1\"\"=200'.  Each 400-scale image nominally covers four U.S. Public Land Survey System sections, for a total of 148 digital image files in the 400-scale data set.  The pixel resolution of the 400-scale imagery is two feet on the ground, and the files contain overlap between images.  Each 200-scale image covers a USPLSS Survey Township, for a total of 16 images in the 200-scale data set. The pixel resolution of the 200-scale imagery is one foot on the ground, again with overlap between images.  The 1\"=400 scale orthophoto files are in GeoTIFF format with accompanying \"\"world\"\" (tfw) files, and the 1\"=200' scale orthophoto files are in MrSID compressed format with the accompanying sid \"world\" (sdw) files.",

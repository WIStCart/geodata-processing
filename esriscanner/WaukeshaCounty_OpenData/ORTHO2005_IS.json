 "dc_description_s": "This data set consists of digital orthophoto images acquired with a Digital Mapping Camera in the spring of 2005. The color images were taken from a nominal flight elevation of 5,000 feet, were compiled at one-inch-equals-100-feet scale, and have a pixel resolution of six inches (6\"). The image files are available in GeoTIFF format and MrSID format.  Each GeoTIFF format file covers an area of 5,000 by 5,000 feet on the Wisconsin State Plane Coordinate System, South Zone, NAD 1927. The 735 GeoTIFF format files have zero overlap betweeen images and have accompanying \"world\" (\".tfw\") files.  The MrSID format files were prepared from mosaics of the GeoTIFF format files.  Each MrSID format file covers an area of approximately one-half of a U.S. Public Land Survey System survey township.  The 32 MrSID format files contain imagery beyond the boundaries of the survey township and do overlap.  The MrSID files have accompanying \"world\" (\".sdw\") files.",

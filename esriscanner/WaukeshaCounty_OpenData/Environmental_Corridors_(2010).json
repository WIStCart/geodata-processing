 "dc_description_s": "This data set contains year 2010 environmental corridors and isolated natural resource areas for the seven-county Southeastern Wisconsin Region. Environmental corridors are areas in the landscape containing especially high value natural, scenic, historic, scientific, and recreational features. The polygon features in this inventory were delineated with reference to a number of Commission data sets, including 2010 Orthophotography, 2005 Environmental Corridor Inventory, 2010 Wisconsin Wetland Inventory, 2010 Land Use Inventory wetlands, and 2005 Natural Areas and Critical Species Habitat Inventories. The primary and secondary environmental corridor areas and isolated natural resource areas were digitized from these source materials by the Southeastern Wisconsin Regional Planning Commission GIS Division.",

 "dc_description_s": "This data set is a\r\ndigital soil survey and generally is the most detailed level of soil geographic\r\ndata developed by the National Cooperative Soil Survey. The information was\r\nprepared by digitizing maps, by compiling information onto a planimetric\r\ncorrect base and digitizing, or by revising digitized maps using remotely\r\nsensed and other information.\r\n\r\nThis data set consists of georeferenced digital map data and\r\ncomputerized attribute data. The map data are in a soil survey area extent\r\nformat and include a detailed, field verified inventory of soils and\r\nmiscellaneous areas that normally occur in a repeatable pattern on the\r\nlandscape and that can be cartographically shown at the scale mapped. A special\r\nsoil features layer (point and line features) is optional. This layer displays\r\nthe location of features too small to delineate at the mapping scale, but they\r\nare large enough and contrasting enough to significantly influence use and\r\nmanagement. The soil map units are linked to attributes in the National Soil\r\nInformation System relational database, which gives the proportionate extent of\r\nthe component soils and their properties.\r\n\r\nSoils\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n  \r\n  1.

Description\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  A definition query was performed\r\n  on each of the limitations using the soils database. In order to avoid\r\n  duplication of features from three soil types (Pm, RkE & RlA), the erase\r\n  function was used from ArcToolbox. By erasing the Depth to Bedrock from the\r\n  the <1 Foot to Water Table, the result of that process erased from the\r\n  <3 Feet to Water Table and finally that result erased from the Percent\r\n  Slope, a heirarchy was established. In order of priority: <1 Foot to Water\r\n  Table, <3 Feet to Water Table, Shallow Bedrock and Slopes >12%.\r\n  \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nDepth to Seasonal High Water Table\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n  \r\n  1. Description\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  Soil polygons displayed, by color,\r\n  according to the DEPTH_TO_WATER_TABLE value field of the soils database.\r\n  Depths were combined to create a specific range.\r\n  \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nHydric Classification\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n  \r\n  1. Description\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  Soil polygons displayed according\r\n  to the HYDRIC_CODE value field of the soils database. Hydric and Hydric\r\n  Inclusions were then color coded.\r\n  \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nHydrologic Soil Group (Native Condition)\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n  \r\n  1. Description\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  Soil polygons displayed according\r\n  to the HYDRIC_SOIL_GROUP value field of the soils database. The different\r\n  soil groups were then color coded. Dual Hydrologic Groups (A/D, B/D &\r\n  C/D) represent drained and undrained conditions. D was designated for these\r\n  groups to represent the native condition of the soil.\r\n  \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nHydrologic Soil Group (Native Condition)\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n  \r\n  1. Description\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  Soil polygons displayed according\r\n  to the HYDRIC_SOIL_GROUP value field of the soils database. The different\r\n  soil groups were then color coded.

Description\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  Soil polygons displayed according\r\n  to the LAND_CAPABILITY_CLASS value field of the soils database. Capability\r\n  classes were then grouped and color coded.\r\n  \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nSoils Parent Material\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n  \r\n  1.

Description\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  Soil polygons displayed, by color,\r\n  according to the SURFACE_TEXTURE value field of the soils database. Sandy\r\n  Soils = Course Sand, Fine Sand, Fine Sandy Loam, Gravelly Sand and Loamy\r\n  Sand. Loamy Soils = Loam and Sandy Loam. Silty Loam Soils = Silt Loam. Clayey\r\n  Soils = Clay, Silty Clay and Silty Clay Loam. Muck Soils = Muck.\r\n  \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

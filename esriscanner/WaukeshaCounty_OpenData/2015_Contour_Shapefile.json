 "dc_description_s": "Corresponding hydro-flattened Digital Terrain Model (DTM) files were created in Esri file geodatabase format. 1-foot contours were created from the hydro-flattened digital terrain model data and delivered in Esri file geodatabase format. The SEWRPC 2015 LiDAR project called for the Planning, Acquisition, processing and derivative products of LIDAR data to be collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 0.7 meters. Project specifications are based on the U.S. Geological Survey National Geospatial Program Base LIDAR Specification, Version 1.2. The primary set of deliverable data was developed based on the following two horizontal projection/datum systems as specified in the contract: NAD83 (2011) State Plane Wisconson South Zone, US survey feet; NAVD88, US survey feet for Waukesha County LiDAR data was delivered in RAW flight line swath format, and processed to create Classified LAS 1.2 Files formatted to individual 10,000-foot x 10,000-foot tiles. Tile counts are listed below: Waukesha: 187 tiles",

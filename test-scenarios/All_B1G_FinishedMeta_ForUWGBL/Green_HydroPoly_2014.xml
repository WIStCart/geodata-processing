      <abstract>This polygon data layer represents hydrography for Green County, Wisconsin in 2014. It is a feature class within the geodatabase, Green_HydroPoly_2014.gdb. [Features were derived from a variety of sources including deeds, descriptions, subdivision maps, certified survey maps, easements, and right of way maps. These source materials were of varying scale and date. This coverage provides a representation of the geometry and topology of tax parcels within the County, and is suitable as a reference layer within the County's GIS.]</abstract>
      <purpose>This layer is intended for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data. [This layer is intended as a base layer for use with other digital data developed by agencies within Green County.]</purpose>
      <supplinf>Augmented original metadata with UW-Madison specific elements. For additional information, please see original license/data sharing agreement where applicable. For complete metadata documentation and online dataset download, please visit http://www.co.green.wi.gov/ [The Land Information Office is part of the Green County Treasurer's Office. The office provides maps, with overlays of parcels, addresses, aerial photos, school districts, soils, and supervisory districts. You may purchase a hard copy map of any portion of Green County by completing the Request for County Maps Form. If you wish to purchase a digital map, you must also complete the License Agreement. Send completed form(s) along with the correct payment to Green County Treasurer, 1016 16th Avenue, Monroe, WI 53566.

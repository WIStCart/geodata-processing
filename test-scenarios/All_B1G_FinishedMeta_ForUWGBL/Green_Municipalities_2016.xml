      <abstract>This polygon data layer represents municipalities for Green County, Wisconsin in 2016. It is a feature class within the geodatabase, Green_Municipalities_2016.gdb.[Features were derived from a variety of sources including deeds, descriptions, subdivision maps, certified survey maps, easements, and right of way maps. These source materials were of varying scale and date. This coverage provides a representation of the geometry and topology of tax parcels within the County, and is suitable as a reference layer within the County's GIS.]</abstract>
      <purpose>This layer is intended for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data.

[This layer is intended as a base layer for use with other digital data developed by agencies within Green County.]</purpose>
      <supplinf>Augmented original metadata with UW-Madison specific elements. For complete metadata documentation, please visit http://www.co.green.wi.gov/localgov_departments_details.asp?deptid=115&amp;locid=148

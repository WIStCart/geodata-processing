      <abstract>This tif-format data image of Wisconsin Land Cover illustrates the Level 2 land cover classification encoded in the Wisconsin Land Cover Grid. The Wisconsin Land Cover Grid is a raster representation of land cover derived from Landsat satellite imagery. The source data were acquired from the nationwide MRLC (Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics Consortium) acquisition of dual-date Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data primarily from 1992. The image processing technique followed was published in the UMGAP Image Processing Protocol (1998).The original pixel size of the source TM data is 30 meters, however the classified WISCLAND Land Cover data (excluding URBAN) are generalized or 'smoothed' to an area no smaller than four contiguous pixels (equivalent to approximately one acre). The result of this smoothing is that any feature five acres or larger may be resolved in the data (i.e., Minimum Mapping Unit (MMU) of five acres). The Land Cover data are usable at nominal scales of 1:40,000 to 1:500,000 for a wide variety of resource management and planning applications. The classification scheme was designed to be compatible with existing classification schemes such as UNESCO's and Anderson's.</abstract>
      <purpose>These data can be used for landscape scale analysis in various disciplines such as wildlife ecology, forestry, or land use planning. The data have been developed for inclusion in the Gap Analysis Program. The data should be used at scales smaller than 1:40,000. It is also suggested that the data be used at no less than the five acre minimum mapping unit. </purpose>
      <supplinf>Extensive additional information about this data set, including data lineage information, is provided in the 'Land Cover of Wisconsin, User's Guide to WISCLAND Land Cover Data', 1999, WiDNR.

      <attraccr>Accuracy Assessment matrices have been completed for each classification unit of the dataset, or 'SCCU' (Spectrally Consistent Classification Unit). These matrices should be referred to when using the WISCLAND Land Cover Data, and are included as MS Excel spreadsheets. Accuracy Assessment was calculated separately for wetlands and uplands. With uplands, errors of omission and commission (both at species level, and generalized level) have been tallied for each classification unit or 'SCCU', including an overall percentage of accuracy, and a K-hat statistic. Wetlands accuracy was also based on the classification unit, with percentage User's accuracy for each class and an overall percentage accuracy. Urban accuracy assessment was performed on its unit of classification, the full TM scene. Both User's and an overall accuracy assessment are given.</attraccr>
    </attracc>
    <complete>A stratified random sampling technique was used to identify 'ground truthing' points for the purpose of land cover classification and accuracy assessment, as described in the WISCLAND Land Cover Protocol. A 'Lineage' document (see Supplemental Information above) lists the final land cover classifications, and classes omitted, for each processing SCCU. </complete>

    <overview>
      <eaover>Each pixel within the WISCLAND Land Cover raster dataset has an associated 8-bit value which corresponds to a Land Cover class. The WISCLAND Land Cover classification scheme is a hierarchical scheme which is modeled after Anderson's Classification scheme (USGS, 1976) but adaptable to other existing classification schemes, especially the UNESCO/The Nature Conservancy classification system. </eaover>
      <eadetcit>WISCLAND LAND COVER CLASSIFICATION SCHEME - Numbers in parentheses are the numeric class values assigned to pixels. The 3-level hierarchy is indicated by decimal values and indentation. Gaps in the numeric and hierarchical sequence are due to entries in the 'extended' classification which were not part of the final WISCLAND classification scheme. (For a complete explanation of the WISCLAND Land Cover classification scheme, refer to the User's Guide cited in the Supplemental Information section.)

"dc_description_s": "These data layers represent parks and recreational areas for Winnebago County, Wisconsin in 2018. It is a feature class within the geodatabase NWinnebago_Parks_Rec_2018.gdbN. The feature layers included in this geodatabase are NWinnebago_Parks_2018N and NWinnebago_Recreation_2018N. [Polygons that represent the boundary or management area for significant facilities in a community. Examples include schools, government facilities, stadiums, casinos, and fire stations. Additional information about each Facility can be organized in to separate tables and related to these locations using the FacilityID key. The feature classification and type schema for the facility sites grew out of work with the Department of Homeland Security's HSIP Program and has evolved to support a diverse set of facilities inventoried for a variety of uses by a local government.]",

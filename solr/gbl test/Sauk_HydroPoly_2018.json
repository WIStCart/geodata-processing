"dc_description_s": "This data layer represents hydrography for Sauk County, Wisconsin in 2018. It is a feature class within the geodatabase, NSauk_HydroPoly_2018.gdbN. [This feature class is made up of polygon features representing waterbodies in Sauk County, WI. The waterbodies were digitized off of the Sauk County 2010 1-foot color ortho-imagery at a scale of 1:600. Spatial accuracy is therefore consistent across the entire county. Vertex density varies between streams depending on the sinuosity of that particular stream. Also, vertex density is intentionally higher within city and village boudaries. To only be viewed at a scale smaller than 1:600.]",

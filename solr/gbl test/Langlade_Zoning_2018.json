One of the first digital layers which are the source of todayâ€™s Zoning Layer Map was completed October 28, 2013 by the North Central Regional Planning Commission. That digital layer is a compilation of those older records, information and data and is intended for reference purposes only. An important note is the Zoning Map was completed first by hand and then digitally a number of years prior to a full Parcel digital map was in place in December 2017. An ongoing effort to align the zoning maps to the parcels is being made.]",
